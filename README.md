# Parsing-BFI-Collections
A programming experiment that uses Python in an attempt to consolidate and structure data from the British Film Institute's online collections database.

The original goal of this project was to write a functional python tool to webscrape the British Film Institute's online collections database and structure that data into an ordered JSON file. The BFI database can be found here: https://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web. Issues with the responsiveness of the database and difficulties with the web scraper forced me to switch gears. The resulting final code attempts to create a structured dataset from HTML source files (included in the repo) that were manually downloaded from the BFI database. The search terms used in the BFI database to produce the source files were: Search in Film and Television Works > Filter - BFI Filmography >  BFI Filmography - all Works > Date - to 1940.
