# Parsing-BFI-Collections
A programming experiment that uses Python in an attempt to consolidate and structure data from the British Film Institute's online collections database.

The original goal of this project was to write a functional python tool to webscrape the British Film Institute's online collections database and structure that data into an ordered JSON file. The BFI database can be found here: https://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web. Issues with the responsiveness of the database and difficulties with the web scraper forced me to switch gears. The resulting final code attempts to create a structured dataset from HTML source files that were manually downloaded from the BFI database. The search terms used in the BFI database were: Search in Film and Television Works > Filter - BFI Filmography >  BFI Filmography - all Works > Date - to 1940.
